W3C defines Custom Elements web components that let authors define their own elements, including new presentation and API, that can be used in HTML documents. There are two main motivations which give air to this development i.e.,

+ Provide a way for Web developers to build their own, fully-featured DOM elements.
+ Rationalize the platform.
+ Make the easy readable markup.
+ Making custom elements with proper functioning as per needs.
+ Less generation of markup.

> You've probably heard all the noise about Web Components and how they're going to change Web development forever. If you haven't, you've either been living under a rock, are reading this article by accident, or have a full, busy life that doesn't leave you time to read about unstable and speculative Web technologies. Well, not me.
