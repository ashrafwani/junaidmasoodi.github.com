If you are learning to code, or already onto it and want your project to be hosted, easily that too free. The answer is Github Pages. IT helps not you only in hosting HTML, CSS and JS files but yeah helps in learning important and tricky tool i.e., Git. In this post i will be helping you as how to publish your project from local repository to github pages.


First of all we need to know about two types of github pages called as

* Userpages
* Project pages

**userpages** come in handy if you want to host your personal website or the index of any project. You may note that there is only one userpage per account. The URL for userpage is http://someproject.github.io/ but **project pages** are used when you want to host a project, of which you have many. We can have multiple project pages per Github account. The URL for project pages are http://someproject.github.io/nameofproject/
