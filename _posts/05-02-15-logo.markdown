<p style="text-align: center;">
Was thinking of creating Logo for my site since long. Here is the first iteration.</p>
<p style="font-family: initial; font-size: 2em;font-weight: bold;text-align: center; font-style: italic">Combination of braces and eye. Which means "what we see is code between braces"</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
Feel free to give your suggestions :) Will love to take advices and suggestions.
