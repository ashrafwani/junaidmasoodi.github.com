Drupal 7 to 8 is a great relief for Front-End's because in Drupal 7 the markup generation was so painfull. But Drupal 8 has overcome this thing and Pages are rendered beautifully and ofcourse with the less markup generation and yes thanks to new theming engine Twig which is used in Drupal 8 rather than template engine.

While writing this post Drupal 8 is in 4th Beta release and is improved with each release. There are lot of exiting features in drupal 8 like

* Theming and Presentaton changes,
* Twig and HTML5 standard markup,
* Better user experience,
* Symphony2 is part of core,
* Mobile friendly,
* RESTful web services,
* Migration API,
* Configuration management and what not.
