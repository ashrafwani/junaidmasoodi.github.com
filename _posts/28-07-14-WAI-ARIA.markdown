WAI-ARIA - Accessible Rich Internet Applications is a way of making Web Applications and Content accessible to those with disabilities, plays nice with application created with Ajax and Javascript. 

After years of development, testing and refining On March 20, 2014, W3C finally [published](http://www.w3.org/blog/2014/03/wai-aria-expands-web-accessibility/) the WAI-ARIA standard version 1.0.

Duplicating functions or emulating the rich components and maximizing the HTTP requests in the background tends to rich user experience. But for assistive technologies like screen readers it is a nightmare, they will fall for accessibility problems. If we built widgets or rich components this way they may be barely accessible via keyboards on screen readers, the function of the widget may not be available for assistive technology, the properties of rich component may not be inherited, updates and discovery of updates will not be recorded and reported by assistive technology.
